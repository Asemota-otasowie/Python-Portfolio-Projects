# Movie Correlation
This is a portfolio of python projects finished and also in progress. it includes all analysis carried out from the preliminary stage to the final stage. All project tells a story , do well to readME.

## Project Overview
### Movie Correlations
The movie correlation project eplores the relationship beteen a movies's budget, its gross earnings and audience votes. The goal was to analyze all aspects of the movie features(ratings, company, country, budget, year etc) and determine which has the highest correlation among themselves and how other factors contribute to finicial success.

## Objective
- Acquire and clean a real-world dataset
- Handle missing values and inconsistent data types
- perform exploratory data analysis(EDA) to uncover patterns
- Determine the correlation between a movies's budget, its gross earnings and votes

### Data Sources
The data source for this analysis was from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), containing information on movies. However , the raw data was messy, requiring extensive cleaning and preprocessing

### Tools
This project was implemented using python with the following libraries:
- Pandas - Data Cleaning and manipulation
  
- Numpy - Data Analysis and numerical computations
  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data visualization
  

### Key findings
- A strong positive correlation was observed between budget and gross earningd. This suggests that higher-budget movies generally tend to make more money for a company.
- A noticeable correlation also existed between audience votes and gross earnings, indicatinf that movies with more votes(likely from higher viewership) tends to have higher earnings

### Challenges & Solutions
- Messy Data: The dataset had a lot of inconsistencies, missing values, and required multiple data type conversion (dtype---astype)
  - Solution: Applied rigorous data cleaning, including filling missing values, handling incorrect data types and ensuring proper formatting

### Next Step
Continue working on more data driven projects to refine analytical skills.
